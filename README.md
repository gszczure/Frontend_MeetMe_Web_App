# MeetMe_Web_App 

## Still a work in progress

This will be the version of my app that works as a website.

* [WEBAPPTEST](https://meetme-web-q5ol.onrender.com/) (first version)
* The next version of the app with visual improvements is not yet published online

Currently, on the first visit to the page, registration or login may take longer to load.

* When testing the application, you do not need to provide real data (the application requires an email address and a phone number, just enter 9 random digits in the phone number field and in the email, just enter the appropriate e-mail pattern ^[\w-\.]+@([\w- ]+\.)+[\w-]{2.4}$

* [FRONTENDMEETINGAPP](https://github.com/gszczure/FRONTENDMEETINGAPP) (frontend for desktop version)
